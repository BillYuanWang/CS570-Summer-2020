## Description

This project is to let us get more familiar with C language. This project contains three directories - zero, data and result.

Source code files and README.md files are in zero folder. Several text files are stored in data folder. Result folder was set to be empty until we run the project. If there are any previous result files in this folder, you can delete them manually or leave them there if you don't need them anymore. If you still want to take a look at these results later, you should back up them before you run the project.

This project is to count the frequency of 'A-Z', 'a-z' and ', . : ; !' in the given data folder. All target files should have a '.txt' extension.

## Usage

Our project contain three folders.

```bash
./
../
./data/
./result/
./zero/
```

Go ahead directory to ```./zero/``` folder, and then enter the command ```make``` to compile the source code to an executable file.

Now we can run our project by entering

```bash
./testalphabet
./testspecial
```

The results will be shown both on the console and saved in the ```../data/``` directory.
